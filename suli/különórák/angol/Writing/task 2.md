# Computers: do they help you to study or stop you studying?
---
We all know that as the modern world is speeding up, we are starting to rely more and more on digital devices. But how does this affect students?

Well, we can surely see the benefits of using computers when you are writing an essay. For example, you can search up biological data of a species and make your writing more factual.

But, on the other hand, computers have many distracting features. When you open up a webpage, it is almost guaranteed that you will see a link to follow up with your ideas. And most of the time, it has no connection to your task and you find yourself on a completely different webpage.

So using a computer doesnt necessarily benefit you, but it has many advantages and can benefit you in many ways. All it takes is the willpower to not get pulled into something you never intended to visit.
