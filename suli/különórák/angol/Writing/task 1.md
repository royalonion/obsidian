Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you in a personal matter regarding your certificates and their recovery process.

I have applied to the University of Cape Town, which requires a language certificate. I have had the chance to get my abilities tested at your facility and I had physical proof my achievements. I had reached a score of 610 on the paper-based test. But somehow, I seem to have misplaced the license as I can not find it. I was wondering if by chance you have kept a copy of my certificate that I could borrow/copy to mail to the university.

Thank you for your help in advance, and I hope you can help me out.

Yours faithfully,
Miklós Tóth-Ferenczi
