Working Paper

Measures to Uphold Legal and Safety Requirements in the Implementation of Refugee Deportations

Committee: Human Rights Council (HRC)

Sponsor: Syrian Arab Republic


---

I. Background and Context

The Syrian Arab Republic has experienced over a decade of armed conflict, resulting in large-scale displacement, destruction of infrastructure, and the disruption of essential public services. Although progress toward stabilization and reconstruction has been achieved in certain regions, conditions across the country remain uneven. Safety, access to housing, employment opportunities, and basic services cannot yet be guaranteed for all returnees.

In recent years, several host states have initiated or expanded deportation practices affecting Syrian refugees. While states retain the sovereign right to regulate migration, deportations carried out without adequate legal safeguards, individualized assessments, and safety guarantees risk violating international human rights and refugee law. Of particular concern is the principle of non-refoulement, as enshrined in Article 33 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which prohibits the return of individuals to territories where their life or freedom would be threatened.

The Syrian Arab Republic maintains that refugee returns must be voluntary, lawful, and dignified, and conducted in coordination with relevant international organizations to ensure the safety and rights of all individuals concerned.

II. Key Challenges

1. Premature or Forced Returns
Deportations conducted before minimum safety and living standards are met risk exposing returnees to insecurity, lack of shelter, and limited access to essential services.


2. Insufficient Legal Safeguards
In some cases, deportation procedures lack effective access to legal counsel, judicial review, and transparent individual risk assessments.


3. Inconsistent Application of Non-Refoulement
Despite widespread recognition of the principle of non-refoulement, its implementation varies significantly between states, creating legal uncertainty and protection gaps for refugees.


4. Limited International Coordination
Unilateral deportation measures undermine cooperation between host states, countries of origin, and international organizations, reducing the effectiveness of return and reintegration processes.

III. Proposed Measures and Recommendations

1. Reaffirmation of International Legal Obligations

Calls upon all Member States to fully comply with Article 33 of the 1951 Refugee Convention and relevant human rights instruments.

Emphasizes that deportations must not occur where there is a credible risk to life, freedom, or physical integrity.



2. Mandatory Individual Risk Assessments

Urges host states to conduct thorough, case-by-case assessments prior to any deportation decision.

Recommends guaranteeing access to legal counsel, interpretation services, and the right to appeal.



3. Promotion of Voluntary and Dignified Returns

Encourages voluntary return programs coordinated with UNHCR and other relevant agencies.

Supports the provision of accurate, up-to-date information to refugees regarding conditions in their areas of origin.



4. International Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms

Proposes the establishment or strengthening of monitoring mechanisms to assess the safety and sustainability of returns.

Calls for regular reporting to relevant UN bodies on deportation practices and their humanitarian impact.



5. Support for Reintegration and Reconstruction

Encourages international assistance for housing, healthcare, education, and employment opportunities for returnees.

Highlights the need to address economic and infrastructural challenges that hinder safe and sustainable returns.

IV. Conclusion

The Syrian Arab Republic reiterates that refugee returns should not be driven by political pressure or administrative convenience, but by respect for international law and human dignity. Upholding legal and safety requirements in deportation procedures is essential to preventing further displacement and ensuring long-term stability. Through cooperation, due process, and adherence to established legal principles, the international community can move toward durable solutions that protect both state sovereignty and human rights.
